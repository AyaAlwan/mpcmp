\title{Non-randomized Probability Integral Transform}
\usage{
compPIT(object, bins = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object class "cmp", obtained from a call to \code{glm.cmp}.}

\item{bins}{numeric: the number of bins used in the PIT.}
}
\value{
compPredProb returns a list with values:
\item{upper}{the predictive cumulative probabilities used as the upper bound for computing the non-randomized PIT.}
\item{lower}{the predictive cumulative probabilities used as the lower bound for computing the non-randomized PIT.}

compPIT returns a list with values:
\item{upper}{the predictive cumulative probabilities used as the upper bound for 
computing the non-randomized PIT.}
\item{lower}{the predictive cumulative probabilities used as the lower bound for 
computing the non-randomized PIT.}
\item{conditionalPIT}{the conditional probability integral transformation 
given the observed counts.}
\item{PIT}{the probability integral transformation.}

\description{
Functions to produce the non-randomized probability integral transform (PIT) to check the
adequacy of the CMP distribution.
}
\details{
These functions are used for the assessment of predictive distributions 
in discrete data. They obtain the predictive probabilities and the probability 
integral transformation for a fitted CMP model.
